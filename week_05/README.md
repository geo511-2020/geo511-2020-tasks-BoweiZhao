In this week, I learned lots of new useful functions in r.  

st_transform():This function can be used to transform or convert coordinates of simple features.  

st_area():This function can be used to compute Euclidian or great circle distance between pairs of geometries. And it also can be used to compute the area or the length of a set of geometries.
